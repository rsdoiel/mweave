<h1>mweave</h1>

<p><em>mweave</em> is a literate programming experiment I started by in 2012. I liked
Donald Knuth&rsquo;s ideas about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>
but didn&rsquo;t wish to write in TeX.  Today I mostly write documents
in an extended version of Markdown or in the case of screenplay&rsquo;s Fountain.
While TeX (and particularly LaTeX) remain really cool in my thinking I just find
it easier to type and proof read in a simpler form of markup.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Where mweave started 2012</h3>

<p>This project started out as an experiment to write a document generator written
for NodeJS&rsquo;s in JavaScript. While I thought of it as &ldquo;literate programming&rdquo; what
I implemented was really just an inside out document generator.  Code blocks that were
preceeded by a link were scraped and written to a file indicated by the targetted link.
I did not use the concepts of &ldquo;tangle&rdquo; and &ldquo;weave&rdquo; individually and I didn&rsquo;t
support the arbitrary ordering of code blocks when generating files.</p>

<p>My bootstrap was written in Bash, it would process the README.md file
using <em>vi</em>, <em>sed</em>, to generate a <em>mw-bootstrap.js</em> and then finally <em>npm</em> to build <em>mw.js</em>.
In the end my initial experiment failed because I failed to use <em>mw.js</em>.  It wasn&rsquo;t compelling.
The version number at npmjs.org shows 0.0.2.</p>

<p>While it was a fun thing to write and think about I moved onto other projects and
languages after 2013.  Of course cool things like <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a>
happened while this experiment languished.</p>

<h3>mweave in January, 2018</h3>

<p>Today I find myself working in a Research Library and literate programming is again
calling to me.  This experiment builds on the 2012 ideas but now is implemented in Golang.
We&rsquo;ll see if this moves beyond a toy program in the coming years. RSD, 2018-01-05</p>

<h2>The experiment</h2>

<p><em>mweave</em> is a Golang package and command line program. It provides both &ldquo;tangle&rdquo; and
&ldquo;weave&rdquo; functions that are expected in literate programming tools today. An <em>mweave</em>
file is presumed to be a UTF-8 plain text file with an extension of &ldquo;.mweave&rdquo; or &ldquo;.mw&rdquo;.
Documentation is rendered to Markdown file(s) and source to the specified source code files.
It is still one command but by picking the <code>-weave</code> or <code>-tangle</code> options you can generate
both documentation (e.g. Markdown output) and source code file(s).
At it&rsquo;s core <em>mweave</em> is a pre-processor that looks for <em>mweave</em> directives. Unlike the 2012
version <em>mweave</em> directives are embedded in HTML/XML style comments.</p>

<p>As an example you can render a <a href="demos/helloworld.py">helloworld</a> python script from <a href="demos/helloworld.mweave">helloworld.mweave</a> using <code>-tangle</code> and render a <a href="demos/helloworld.md">helloworld</a> Markdown page by using
<code>-weave</code>. Processing that markdown using a Markdown process like <a href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/mkpage">mkpage</a>
would give you the final <a href="demos/helloworld.html">helloworld</a> page.</p>

<p>Here is the example mweave file&ndash;</p>

<pre><code>    # Hello World!

    This is an example of an embedded document to be extracted by 
    [mweave](https://github.com/rsdoiel/mweave).
    &lt;!--mweave:begin &quot;helloworld.py&quot; 0 --&gt;
    ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
    ```
    &lt;!--mweave:end --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the commands to render <a href="demos/helloworld.md">helloworld.md</a> and <a href="demos/helloworld.py">helloworld.py</a>
from our <a href="demos/helloworld.mweave">helloworld.mweave</a> source.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">    mweave -weave -i helloworld.mweave -o helloworld.md
    mweave -tangle -i hellowolrd.meave
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that tangle ignores the output file name. That is beceause the source files are set in the
mweave begin directive.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p><em>mweave</em> reads in the entire source document splitting it up based on the directives it encounters.
There are two directives - <em>mweave:begin</em> and <em>mweave:end</em>.  <em>mweave:begin</em> takes two required
parameters, the filename (string) and an order value (an integer). The ordering value is used by
tangle to order blocks of texts associated with the filename. <em>mweave:end</em> takes no parameter.
Currently I have no other directives planned. I am considering integrating
<a href="https://github.com/rsdoiel/shorthand">shorthand</a> as the macro system sometime in the future.
The <em>mweave</em> directives are expected to be the first non-space element on the line.
They take up a whole line.</p>

<p>This 2nd <em>mweave</em> experiment is still rediculiously simple like 2012. v0.1.0 was I implemented
in less than a day so I could experiment again with literate programming.  I am trying to sort out how
simple a tool I can write and still support literate programming. My hypothis is that if the
tool is simple enough I might actually use it and find it more useful and interesting to maintain.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Golang version 1.9.2 or better</li>
</ul>

<p><em>mweave</em> is &ldquo;go get&rdquo;-able.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">    go get -u github.com/rsodiel/mweave/...
</code></pre>
