<h1>mweave</h1>

<p><em>mweave</em> is a <em>literate programming</em> experiment I started by in 2012. I liked
Donald Knuth&rsquo;s ideas about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>
but didn&rsquo;t enjoy the implementations. This incarnation of my experiment (2018)
I am looking at <em>literate programming</em> from the perspective of a <em>writing tool</em>
for creative projects in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">interactive fiction</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_literature">electronic literature</a>.</p>

<h2>mweave experiment history</h2>

<h3>mweave started 2012</h3>

<p>This project started out as an experiment to write a document generator written
for NodeJS&rsquo;s in JavaScript. While I thought of it as &ldquo;literate programming&rdquo; what
I implemented was really just an inside out document generator.  Code blocks that were
preceeded by a link were scraped and written to a file indicated by the targetted link.
I did not use the concepts of &ldquo;tangle&rdquo; and &ldquo;weave&rdquo; individually and I didn&rsquo;t
support the arbitrary ordering of code blocks or macros.</p>

<p>My bootstrap was written in Bash, it processed the README.md file using <em>vi</em>, <em>sed</em>,
to generate a <em>mw-bootstrap.js</em> and then that processed a file, <em>mw.md</em> to implement
<em>mw.js</em> and <em>npm</em> to assemble dependencies.  In the end my initial experiment failed because
I failed to use <em>mw.js</em> on a regular basis.  It wasn&rsquo;t compelling.  The version number
at npmjs.org shows 0.0.2. I&rsquo;ve since flagged it as deprecated. I am no longer developing
a NodeJS based implementation.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something practicle two interesting projects capture what I was
thinking about. They are <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a>  and <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown">R Notebooks</a>.
Both have grown out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open Science</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">Open Data</a> communities. Very cool stuff.</p>

<h3>mweave in January, 2018</h3>

<p>Today I find myself working in a Research Library and literate programming is again
calling to me.  This experiment builds on the 2012 ideas but now is implemented in Golang.
We&rsquo;ll see if this moves beyond a toy program in the coming years. RSD, 2018-01-05</p>

<h2>The experiment</h2>

<pre><code>Can _mweave_ be a useful tool for writing interactive fiction?  
</code></pre>

<p><em>mweave</em> is a Golang package and command line program. It provides both &ldquo;tangle&rdquo; and
&ldquo;weave&rdquo; functions.  The <em>mweave</em> command line program integrates macro support by
pre-processing the text through <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/shorthand">shorthand</a> a
very simple label expander. An <em>mweave</em> file is a UTF-8 plain text file with an
extension of &ldquo;.mweave&rdquo; or &ldquo;.mw&rdquo;.  Documentation is rendered to Markdown file(s)
and source to the specified source code files. Like the original project <em>mweave</em>
is still one command but the explicit options of <code>-weave</code> or <code>-tangle</code> are now
included so you can generate both markdown and source code files.</p>

<p>At it&rsquo;s core <em>mweave</em> is a pre-processor that looks for <em>mweave</em> directives. Unlike the 2012
version <em>mweave</em> directives are embedded as an HTML/XML style comments.</p>

<h3>Hello World</h3>

<p>As an example you can render a <a href="demos/helloworld.py">helloworld</a> python script from <a href="demos/helloworld.mweave">helloworld.mweave</a> using <code>-tangle</code> and render a <a href="demos/helloworld.md">helloworld</a> Markdown page by using
<code>-weave</code>. Processing that markdown using a Markdown process like <a href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/mkpage">mkpage</a>
would give you the final <a href="demos/helloworld.html">helloworld</a> page.</p>

<p>Here is the example mweave file&ndash;</p>

<pre><code>    # Hello World!

    This is an example of an embedded document to be extracted by 
    [mweave](https://github.com/rsdoiel/mweave).
    &lt;!--mweave:source &quot;helloworld.py&quot; 0 --&gt;
    ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
    ```
    &lt;!--mweave:end --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the commands to render <a href="demos/helloworld.md">helloworld.md</a> and <a href="demos/helloworld.py">helloworld.py</a>
from our <a href="demos/helloworld.mweave">helloworld.mweave</a> source.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">    mweave -weave -i helloworld.mweave -o helloworld.md
    mweave -tangle -i hellowolrd.meave
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that tangle ignores the output file name. That is beceause the source files are set in the
mweave begin directive.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p><em>mweave</em> reads in the entire source document and runs through the <em>shorthand</em> macro expander. It then
splits the document into plain text sections and source sections.  Source sections start with
<em>mweave:source</em> and end with a <em>mweave:end</em> HTML style comment.  <em>mweave:source</em> takes two required
parameters, the filename (string) and an order value (an integer). The ordering value is used by
tangle to order blocks of texts associated with the filename.</p>

<p>Before parsing into source and plain text blocks the <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/shorthand">shorthand</a>
macro processor runs over the code and the resulting text is then parsed into source and plain text.
See <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/rsdoiel/shorthand/docs">shorthand</a> for details about <em>shorthand</em>.</p>

<p>This 2nd <em>mweave</em> experiment is still rediculiously simple like 2012. v0.1.0 was I implemented
in less than a day so I could experiment again with literate programming using the HTML comment
indicator for flag source files to output. v0.1.1 integrated a macro system was another day
(though the macro engine already existed). I am trying to sort out how simple a tool I can write
and still support literate programming. My hypothis is that if the tool is simple enough I might
actually use it and find it more useful and interesting to maintain.</p>
