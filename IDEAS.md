Some feature ideas:

+ Embed a comment in the render code file(s) that indicate where they came from in the Markdown document
    - e.g. /*mweave 2,14 myMardownFile.md */
+ Add source map support
+ Add support for name of file to be rendered to end block quote rather than be immediately before it.
+ Figure out a way to have multiple blocks accumulate but output only the last link to the final version
